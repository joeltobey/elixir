# ColdBox Elixir

## Introduction

> ColdBox Elixir is a direct port of the [Laravel Elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir) project.

ColdBox Elixir provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your ColdBox MVC applications. Elixir supports several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors, and even testing tools.

If you've ever been confused about how to get started with Gulp and asset compilation, you will love ColdBox Elixir!

## Developing

If you want to develop and hack around then you must have nodeJS installed. Then run the following in the root:

```
npm install
```

Then make sure you create a symbolic link to the root folder in your `node_modules` directory in order for all the mocha tests to execute correctly
```
cd node_modules
ln -s ../ coldbox-elixir
```
